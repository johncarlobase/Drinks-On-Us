PROJECT#3 MARKDOWN

## Drinks-On-Us
    A simple app to give you ideas on what you can drink for today. When you are tired of the ol' Rum and Coke. 


## Motivation
Stuck at home in Quarantine?  Make it a day of Quarandrinkin' with our app!  

    April 2020,  Covid-19 Quarantine and we were asked to think of a project that can be useful to the public.  So we thought to scratch event apps, socialization, meetups or any public gathering. Since everybody is at home and liquor stores are open. And headlines such as this: [news headline](https://abc7amarillo.com/news/local/pandemic-leads-to-increased-alcohol-sales-at-liquor-stores)
